## Python Basic Documentation

***

When using a software for real application or software development, there are few things you need to do except for merely writing codes. You need to use pre-existing stuff to help you accelerating developing speed. For example, to wrting an email client end, if you start from the most fundamental level with TP/ICP protocol, you might spend several years to finish the software. Premium programming languages usually provide a very detailed and completed basic code repository to let you declare at anytime you want, like the SMTP for email protocol or GUI for desktop environment.

Python provides us with very completed basic code packages that covers network, file management, GUI, database and text, they can be metaphored as batteries included.

There are also packages from third parties that you may wanna use.

Many websites were developed by Python, for example, YouTube, Instagram and Douban in China. Big companies including Google, Yahoo and even NASA are using Python widely.

Python is very light, elegant and precise, so lines of Python codes usually are very easy to understand. 

### Cons of Python

Two main cons of Python are on *executing speed* and *encryption*.

## Simulation

### Cut the potato

This is a big question. Hmm, human spent half of a century inventing personal computer, from the size of a class room down to the size of adult's hand. We even sent men to the moon (whether it was true or just a fake), we still can not codebreak the secrets underlying in ourselves. 

Computer is a remarkable thing. The machine can literally do things repeatedly, if you provides it with power (and also efficient algorithms and programs to excute). Human labor is expensive, therefore we usually hand over repreated thing to computer. For example, the simulation. 

So how do you do a computational simulation?

First, you need to know the object you wanna simulate? What do you want to simulate? Is it abstract? Or vivid as the graphic presentation in front of your eyes? To build up a simulation, the only thing you care about is the fundamental function that computer provides to you: it can do thing **repeatedly**.

Repeatedly. We learnt about differentiation and integration in freshmam year, what did the professor tell on the lecture was pretty iconic. You have an object, you wanna calculate the volumn of it, for example, a ball. Of course you can directly use the sphere volume equation, with its diameter's cube and you multiply it with Pi and four over three. Bang, you will get a very precise number. The ancient Greeks had already discovered the way to calculate it, what you are doing is only appling the equation. 

Most people think this is all about mathematics. Oh come on, only multiplication and division? No, that's not enough. 

Let's think it deeper. What if you do not know the value of Pi? What if you have no idea about the spherical volume equation at all? What if you were an ancient Greek and you only can do the volume of something cube-like?

Imagine the ball to be a potato, and you wanna slice it with a sharp knife to make potato dices. I remember the scenario that my mon diced the potato into small pieces for delicious soup when I was of very young age. She would cut the potato in three procedures. First, slice it into chips, then cut them  into bars and finally dice them into pieces. Except for those portion at the edge, most of the potato pieces are very regular shaped - something looks like a cube. 

That's it! I knew how to do the math about cubic volume.

I collected those cubes and measured the length of each side, for the remaining pieces from edges, I tried to imagine them into same cubes as the others (that's how approximation came into this case). I counted the total number of pieces and applied a little bit very simple multiplication and voila, the total volume of potato was there. 

That was how mathematics works.

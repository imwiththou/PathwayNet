## New stuff

Thinking about a new model that simulates vitamin C synthesis.

There are several papers on this topic on web. Do some research work next week and hopefully will write the ODE first, before getting the simulation working on computer. 

### L-Ascorbate synthesis pathway

D-Glucose-6-P <=> D-Fructose-6-P <=> D-Mannose-6-P <=> D-Mannose-1-P -> GDP-D-Mannose <=> GDP-L-Galactose -> L-Galactose-1-P -> L-Galactose -> L-Galactono-1,4-lactone -> L-Ascorbic acid

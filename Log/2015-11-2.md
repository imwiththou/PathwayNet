## Sit down and rethink

Finally the toughest project final report was submitted today sharpely at 6pm, the deadline. 

To be honest I never fond of pushing the work to last mintue. This project was a big one with 11 member in a group. It became so hard to coordinate everyone from day one. It takes too long to get progress update from each subteam, and it takes time to proofread and compilation into an elegant document.

It all takes time.

So we were astonishly rushing towards the deadline, literally.

Inspired a little bit when rougly reading through a book brought by a friend, *Hackers and painters* by Paul Graham.
